# Data Analysis on the Adult Dataset

This repository contains a data analysis project performed on the Adult dataset. The Adult dataset, which contains demographic data about people and their income levels, is a commonly used dataset in machine learning and data mining.

## Dataset Description

The Adult dataset provides information about various attributes of individuals, including age, education, occupation, marital status, and more. The goal of the analysis is to explore the relationship between these attributes and and to perform some basic analysis to improve the understanding of the dataset.

The dataset consists of two main files:

- `adult.csv`: This file contains the main dataset in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format.
- `adult.names`: This file provides detailed descriptions and information about the dataset, including attribute names, data types, and potential missing values.

## Analysis Process

The data analysis on the Adult dataset was conducted using Python and popular data analysis libraries, such as Pandas and Matplotlib.

The analysis process involved the following steps:

- Data Loading: The dataset was loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for further processing and analysis.
- Data Cleaning: Missing values, if any, were handled, and data inconsistencies were addressed.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Various exploratory techniques were employed to gain insights into the dataset. This included statistical summaries, data visualization, and correlation analysis.
- Data Preprocessing: Data preprocessing techniques such as one-hot encoding, label encoding, or scaling were applied to prepare the data for modeling.
- Feature Engineering: Additional features were created or modified based on domain knowledge or data transformation requirements.
- Results and Conclusion: The findings and conclusions drawn from the analysis were summarized, and any insights or observations were documented.

## Requirements

To replicate the analysis, the following dependencies need to be installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Sklearn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Usage

To run the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/John-5014/Data-Analysis-with-Pandas.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory and execute the cells sequentially.

Feel free to explore the notebooks, modify the code, and adapt the analysis according to your requirements.
